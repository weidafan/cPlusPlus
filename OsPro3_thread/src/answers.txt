1. how do you determine the number of threads you should launch to realistically test your application?
	if you run all  asynchrounous threads then just use random number of threads.
if you run synchrounous threads then use as many as you can, because the more threads you test the more chance you catch a crash.But The number of contention points is likely to be the number of threads sharing a core, since a core can either run one or two logical threads,so The optimal number of threads is likely to be either the number of cores in your machine. 	


2. if you are lunching several threads, under what circumstances would these threads not run in parellel on a modern processor?
	These threads are running in different processes. Multithreading is not equal to parallelism. If all threads run in one core, then you are not doing parallelism.
